Country List App
- Using SwiftUI.
- Using Apollo to fetch GraphQL data.

Directions:
- I did not include the podfiles or the API.swift but included is the podfile, the podfile.lock, schema and .graphql file.
- run `pod install` and build the to generate a API.swift file.

Thank you for the opportunity. Have a wonderful week.
